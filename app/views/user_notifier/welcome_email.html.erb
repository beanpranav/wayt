	<p>Thanks for signing up for 'what are your thoughts?', <%= @user.first_name %>!</p>
	<p>
		The first thing you'll need to do is <a href="new_friendship_url">add a couple of friends</a> using their email ids.
		<br>Then you can compose conversations and send it to them, just as you'd do in gmail. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Have fun debating, discussing and reflecting on ideas with your close friends. 
		<br>Welcome :)
	</p>
	<p>
		Best,
		<br>Pranav
